# Mini project, using python tool to create Spirographs

This mini-project is a replication of work done by [Electronut Labs](http://electronut.in/) that uses parametric equations to draw a circle.
I've personally not used any trig functions since high school back in the late '80 early 90's; I graduated Matric or St 10 class of '91.  So this mini-project is an interesting refresher!
I came across this work, in an eBook, called Python [Playground: Geeky Projects for the Curious Programmer](https://g.co/kgs/quxp9B)
I've done this for the simple pure enjoyment factor of working with Python
